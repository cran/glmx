  o Small documentation improvements.


Changes in Version 0.1-2

  o Improved family initialization in case of binomial (rather than binary)
    models.

  o Unified spelling to "heteroscedastic" rather than "heteroskedastic".

  o Added some 'tests' as well as reference output for the examples.


Changes in Version 0.1-1

  o Added predict() method for "glmx" objects.
  
  o Small improvements in NAMESPACE.


Changes in Version 0.1-0

  o First CRAN release of "glmx". However, all functions are
    still under development and both interfaces and internals
    might change in future releases.
    
  o The main functions are hetglm() for heteroscedastic GLMs
    (in particular heteroscedastic probit etc.), glmx() for GLMs
    with extra parameters (such as parametric links), and a collection
    of parametric links for binary regressions.
