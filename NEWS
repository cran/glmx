Changes in Version 0.1-0

  o First CRAN release of "glmx". However, all functions are
    still under development and both interfaces and internals
    might change in future releases.
    
  o The main functions are hetglm() for heteroskedastic GLMs
    (in particular heteroskedastic probit etc.), glmx() for GLMs
    with extra parameters (such as parametric links), and a collection
    of parametric links for binary regressions.
